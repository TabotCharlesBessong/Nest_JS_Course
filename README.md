# NestJS: A Beginner's Guide

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is a popular open-source framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications using Node.js. It is built on top of Express.js, which is one of the most widely used Node.js frameworks for web development. NestJS is designed to make it easy to build complex, modular, and scalable applications with a focus on developer productivity.

## Why is NestJS Important?

One of the key benefits of NestJS is its modular architecture, which allows developers to build applications using a collection of reusable and interchangeable modules. This approach makes it easier to maintain and scale applications over time, as well as to share code between projects.

NestJS also provides out-of-the-box support for a range of important features, including dependency injection, middleware, authentication, and more. This helps developers to focus on building the core functionality of their applications, rather than worrying about low-level details.

## Getting Started with NestJS

Before you can get started with NestJS, you'll need to make sure that you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

Once you have Node.js and your preferred package manager installed, you can use the package manager to install the Nest CLI, which is a command-line tool that helps you create and manage NestJS projects. To install the Nest CLI using npm, you can run the following command:

```
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

To create a new NestJS project, you can run the following command:

```
nest new my-project
```

This will create a new NestJS project in a directory called `my-project`. You can then start the development server by running:

```
cd my-project
npm run start
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`, and you can begin building your NestJS application. You can also use pnpm or yarn to run the same commands, depending on your preferred package manager.

## Conclusion

Overall, NestJS is an important and powerful framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications using Node.js. Its modular architecture, built-in features, and developer-friendly approach make it a popular choice for developers of all skill levels.

Happy coding!
